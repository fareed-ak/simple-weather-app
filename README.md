# Weather App 🌦️
[Live Demo](https://fareed-ak.github.io/simple-weather-app/)

A simple weather app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to practice working with real APIs and async JavaScript.

The app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch current weather data.

- OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API  
- OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API
